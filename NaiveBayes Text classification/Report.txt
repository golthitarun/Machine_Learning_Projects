
Description:

- Implemented a Naive bayes classification on the 20 News group dataset.
- This is impleted in Python 2.7
- The header in each document is ignored during the training and testing of the classifier. 
- We used Nltk libraries to extract vocabulary from the documents and also to remove Stopwords and Common words in english( so as to increase the accuracy of classification )
- To reduce the processing time we are only implementing this classifier on the first five classes of the 20 News group dataset.
